# Keyboard_Configurations

.vil file extension = [Vial](https://get.vial.today/)

Currently, I configured my GMMK Pro via Vial but I want to eventually port it over to QMK since [Pascal Getreuer's Autocorrect](https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/autocorrection/index.html) is only available through QMK flashing.
