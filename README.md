# Keyboard_Configurations

.vil file extension = [Vial](https://get.vial.today/)

Currently, I configured my GMMK Pro via Vial but I want to eventually port it over to QMK since [Pascal Getreuer's Autocorrect](https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/autocorrection/index.html) is only available through QMK flashing.

## Monitor Brightness

I use [Lunar](https://lunar.fyi/). Additionally for MacOS multi-monitor support, I use a [Dell Universal Docking Station](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-universal-dock-ud22/apd/210-bexr/docks?tfcid=91049735&dgc=opl&gacd=9684992-1102-5761040-266906002-0&dgc=ST&SA360CID=71700000117208879&&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwouexBhAuEiwAtW_Zx98oEE1jS9kaOIqrwS8WQ3Y_eyJxxDPZnM_wN1CZS_cLCAXscA6vYxoCeocQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) along with [DisplayLink Manager software](https://www.synaptics.com/products/displaylink-graphics/downloads/macos) (ensure your resolution is min(monitors) otherwise DisplayLink will throw a fit).

## MacOS Mappings

To map Caps Lock to Escape (alone) or Hyperkey ⌃⌥⇧⌘ in MacOS only for vim, download Karabiner Elements and use this [Complex Modification](https://ke-complex-modifications.pqrs.org/#caps_lock_to_hyper_or_esc_if_alone)

Also download [Charmstone](https://charmstone.app/) and set the hyperkey to your trigger.
